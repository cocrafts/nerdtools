# Configuration reference

Every option
[`@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-todo)
reads, where the file lives, and exactly what happens when a value is wrong.

## Where the file lives

The config file is optional. It is resolved in this order:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpiv-todo/config.json` — used when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set
   to an absolute path. A bare `~` or a leading `~/` is expanded first; a `~user`
   form is not expanded and therefore falls through.
2. `~/.config/rpiv-todo/config.json` — used when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset,
   empty, whitespace-only, or relative.
3. If the XDG file does not exist, the legacy `~/.config/rpiv-todo/config.json`
   is read anyway, so a pre-XDG file is still found after you set
   `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. This fallback is one-way: if the XDG file exists but is
   malformed, you get a warning and defaults — it does **not** quietly read the
   legacy file instead.

Both files missing means every default applies. Malformed JSON prints a
`rpiv-config: invalid JSON at …` warning and is treated as `{}`. A JSON array or
a non-object value (`null`, a string, a number, a boolean) is silently treated as
`{}` — no warning.

`rpiv-todo` never writes this file — you create and edit it yourself, and the
extension only reads it.

## Example

```json
{
  "maxWidgetLines": 8,
  "collapseKey": "alt+t",
  "guidance": {
    "promptSnippet": "Use the `todo` tool to track multi-step work before starting it.",
    "promptGuidelines": [
      "Create one task per discrete step.",
      "Mark a task in_progress while working on it; completed when done."
    ]
  }
}
```

## `maxWidgetLines`

**Default `12`.** The content-row budget for the overlay — the heading row and,
on overflow, the `+N more` summary row both count against it. Only the trailing
blank spacer sits outside the budget, so `12` renders up to 13 terminal rows.

- Floor of `3`. A number below `3` falls back to the default.
- A non-number falls back to the default.
- No ceiling.
- Read fresh on every render, so a change takes effect on the next repaint —
  no `/reload`.
- Pi's tool-output expansion mode (`ctrl+o` by default) temporarily overrides
  this budget and shows every task; collapsing restores the configured budget.

## `collapseKey`

**Default `"ctrl+shift+t"`.** The shortcut that collapses and expands the
overlay.

The value is trimmed and lowercased, then matched against Pi's keybinding
grammar: zero or more distinct modifiers joined by `+`, then a base key.

| Part | Accepted |
| --- | --- |
| Modifiers | `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super` — each at most once |
| Base key | one printable character (`a`, `7`, `]`, `/`, …) |
| Base key | a named key: `escape`, `esc`, `enter`, `return`, `tab`, `space`, `backspace`, `delete`, `insert`, `clear`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `f1`–`f12` |

Examples: `alt+o`, `ctrl+shift+t`, `super+alt+f5`.

- A missing, empty, blank, non-string, or ungrammatical value falls back to the
  default. The grammar is checked strictly on purpose: Pi takes the last `+`-part
  as the base key and ignores unknown parts, so a typo like `ctr+]` would
  otherwise capture every bare `]` keypress globally.
- `"off"` disables the feature — no shortcut is registered at all.
- The binding is resolved **once at extension load**. After editing this value,
  run `/reload` to rebind; until you do, the old key stays active even though the
  collapsed panel's hint text (which is resolved per render) already shows the
  new one.

## Guidance

`guidance.promptSnippet` (string) and `guidance.promptGuidelines` (array of
strings) replace the prompt copy the `todo` tool advertises to the model. Both
are absent by default, in which case the built-in snippet and the eight built-in
guideline bullets are used.

- `promptSnippet` must be a non-empty string; an empty string or a wrong type
  falls back to the default.
- `promptGuidelines` must be a non-empty array of non-empty strings. A non-array,
  or an array containing an empty string, falls back to the default — the array
  is all-or-nothing, not merged item by item.
- Both are read at extension load, so `/reload` after editing them.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Relocates the config directory, as described above. |
| `HOME` | Anchors `~/.config` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` does not apply. |

`rpiv-todo` reads no environment variables of its own. If you have
[`@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n)
installed, that package has its own locale configuration and its own env-var
chain — see its README.
