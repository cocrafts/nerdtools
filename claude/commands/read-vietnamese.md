---

## Task

## Steps

1. Read the file at: $1
2. Translate the entire content to Vietnamese (keep it natural and fluent)
3. Use the following bash command to speak the translation:

```bash
SPEED="${2:-1.5}"  # Default to 1.5 if not provided
WPM=$(echo "200 * $SPEED" | bc | cut -d. -f1)

echo "[Translated Vietnamese text here]" | say -v "Linh" -r "$WPM" &

echo "ðŸ”Š Speaking in Vietnamese at ${SPEED}x speed ($WPM wpm)"
echo "ðŸ’¡ To stop: Use /stop-reading or run: killall say"
```

## Important

- Translate the ENTIRE file content to natural, fluent Vietnamese
- Keep the translation conversational and easy to understand
