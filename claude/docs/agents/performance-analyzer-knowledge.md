## Token Usage Optimization

### Understanding Token Economics

#### Token Calculation Basics
```
Input Tokens = System Prompt + User Message + Tool Results + Context
Output Tokens = Assistant Response + Tool Calls
Total Cost = (Input Tokens * Input Rate) + (Output Tokens * Output Rate)
```

#### Claude Code Session Limits
- 5-hour rolling window system
- Token limits apply within each session
- Automatic session adaptation based on usage patterns
- 192-hour (8-day) analysis window for personalized limits

### Token Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Context Window Management
```yaml
Strategies:
  Chunking:
    - Focus on one directory at a time
    - Process files in logical groups
    - Clear context between major tasks
  
  Selective Loading:
    - Read only necessary files
    - Use grep/glob for targeted searches
    - Avoid loading entire codebases
  
  Context Pruning:
    - Summarize lengthy outputs
    - Remove redundant information
    - Use references instead of full content
```

#### 2. Efficient Tool Usage
```yaml
Best Practices:
  Batch Operations:
    - Multiple greps in parallel
    - Bulk file reads
    - Combined edits with MultiEdit
  
  Targeted Searches:
    - Specific grep patterns
    - Narrow glob scopes
    - Precise file paths
  
  Avoid Redundancy:
    - Cache search results
    - Reuse previous findings
    - Skip unnecessary confirmations
```

#### 3. Response Optimization
```yaml
Output Efficiency:
  Conciseness:
    - Minimal preamble/postamble
    - Direct answers
    - No unnecessary explanations
  
  Structured Data:
    - Use lists over paragraphs
    - Tables for comparisons
    - Code blocks without commentary
  
  Temperature Settings:
    - Use 0.5 for technical precision
    - Lower temperature = more focused responses
    - Higher temperature only for creative tasks
```

### Token Monitoring and Analytics

#### Real-time Monitoring Metrics
```python
# Key Metrics to Track
token_metrics = {
    "current_usage": 0,
    "session_limit": 100000,

    "time_remaining": 0,  # minutes
    "cost_accumulated": 0.0,
    "efficiency_score": 0.0
}
```

                      (Expected Time / Actual Time) * 
                      Quality Factor
    """
    score = {
        "token_efficiency": expected_tokens / actual_tokens,
        "time_efficiency": expected_time / actual_time,
        "quality_factor": assess_output_quality(),
        "overall_score": 0.0
    }
    score["overall_score"] = (
        score["token_efficiency"] * 0.4 +
        score["time_efficiency"] * 0.3 +
        score["quality_factor"] * 0.3
    )
    return score
```
